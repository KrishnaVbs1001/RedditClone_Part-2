# RedditClone_Part-2
Final project in Distributed Operating System Principles course
## Problem Definition
* Implement REST API interface for the engine you designed in project 4.1(Reddit Clone Part-1). Use structure similar to Redit's official API (does not need to be identical).
* Implement a simple client that uses the REST API to perform each piece of functionality you support.
* Run your engine with multiple clients to show that functionality works.
